She.Gurus started with the difficulty and lack of support found by so many women who are starting their professional life in the field of Technology and so many others who have long been in their careers and see the lack of more female labor in the technological market.
The aim is to build a more unity and more supportive community in areas dominated by the male majority.

#### She.Gurus promotes gender diversity and inclusion, therefore all are welcome to our platform.
